  * <b>Clashing traits</b> Sometimes the traits used to mixin have methods with identical signatures

  *  1: Same signatures and return types traits
  *  2: Same signatures and different return types traits
  *  3: Same signatures and return types mixins
  *  4: Same signatures and different return types mixins */

  *   trait FormalGreeting { def getTime(): String }
  *   trait InformalGreeting { def getTime(): Int }

  * 
  * This problem does not exist when input parameters to the methods differ either by type or by count since this is a new signature.

  * 
  * Which hello method will be called and why? In the current case, it will be the one in the BB trait and the output will be Hello, 
  * I am trait BB! This depends on `linearization` in Scala, and we will be looking into this later in this chapter.

/** <b>Clash 4: `Same signatures and different return types mixins`</b>

  * {{{
  *   def value(a: Int): Int = a // in trait AA
  *   def value(a: Int): String = a.toString // in trait BB
  * }}}
  * 
  * If we override the value method in the AA trait we would get the error: 
  *   `overriding method value in trait BB of type (a: Int)String; method value has incompatible type`
  * 
  * If we override the value method in the BB trait, the error will change respectively.
  * 
  * If we try to override both methods we would get a "method value is defined twice " error.
  * 
  * Scala prevents us from doing things for sake of avoiding problems in multiple inheritance.
